Enjoy-SP_Mod for Diablo II Resurrected

***********************************************************
==== Enjoy-SP Mod (by BanzaiAttack and SilentStorm989) ====
***********************************************************

This mod is devoted to people who want to enjoy the single player mode to the full extend. This is mainly achieved by increasing 
the overall droprates of unique, set and rare items as well as runes. Also, the drop drates of very rare items such as Tyrael's Might
or high runes have been adjusted to a reasonable degree. Bosses in particular received an independend increase of their dropchances 
for unique items, thus are more satisfying to slay. Some Boss-drops were altered to fit certain themes. All unique items were included 
furthermore  A more fluent gameplay is provided by adjusting the experience gain on higher levels - so no more hard grinding after the 80s. 

The goal for this mod was to enable all the Diablo-content for the single player while keeping the "vanilla-feeling". This mod 
emphasizes on the distinction between Drop-Mods such as "The Perfect Drop Mod". It is not the goal of this mod to rain-down uniques
on a player. It rather wants to give a player the opportunity, or better, the possibility of exploring the full content of the game
without losing its core mechanics. So if you want to play a single player session and want a realistic chance of actually getting
unique items like Tyrael's, Windforce or Grandfather, then this mod is for you. It is of course not guarenteed that you will find all
of the items the game has to offer, but it is certain when played multiple times!
